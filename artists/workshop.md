excerpt: "This series of illustration spans several traditional and digital mediums. It is just as much about the subject matter as the journey it took to get to finished pieces. Take a look at how it came together."

I used a traditional process to create the artworks, with the only exception of scanning and color correction in Photoshop. Layering of pencil, ink, and paint produced densely detailed and vibrant illustrations. I drew the concepts using Mitsubishi Hi-Uni pencils, imagining how they would look once fully painted. At this stage, it was important to imagine the shadows and shades that would show up in the final painting.

Once I completed sketching the project, I began the tense process of inking the piece. Traditional inking is an, "all or nothing" approach where, after years of experimenting, I've truly learned to avoid sketching on the page. Confident, clear strokes brought this piece together. Additionally, I made a point of avoiding rulers or straight edges in the inking stage. A common issue I've found in ink drafting pieces is an over dependence in ruling tools.

Watercolor, my medium of choice for coloring this project, is a fickle paint which takes patience and practice in order to apply it on a page. While painting, I had to think about variables including paint texture, water concentration, pigment use, and brush wetness. I utilized Holbein watercolors, with RaphaÃ«l SoftAqua brushes and Arches watercolor paper. I put special attention towards painting with primarily single pigment paint that stays vibrant on the page.
