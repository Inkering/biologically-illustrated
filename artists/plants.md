excerpt: "Plants are everywhere, including our homes. They, for better or worse, are exploited constantly for their properties and visual appeal. What if the plants that decorate our built environment played a more outsized role-One that is proportional to their importance in the Earth?"

The study of biology is not limited to cellular or molecular biology. Understanding and having a broad view of animal and plant life is also important, in my opinion. In recognition of the beauty of plants, this piece serves as a marker of a lower level of abstraction. Lower, in the sense that the elements featured in this drawing quite closely resemble (artistic choices aside) actual plants. The colors are chosen to recall the viewers memories of actual plant life. In the case of cell structures, we have never seen a purple nucleus, and rely on textbook education to make those structures familiar.
